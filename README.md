# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Rabii Zahnoune (@rabiizahnoune)

## üëÄ About Me
I am a software engineering graduate now expanding my skills in data engineering. With a passion for technology and data, I am diving deep into fields like machine learning, data analysis, and data processing. My goal is to bridge my knowledge in software development with the dynamic world of data engineering.

## üå± Currently Learning
I‚Äôm currently enrolled in a data engineering training program, working on projects in SQL, data visualization, web scraping, and machine learning. This hands-on approach allows me to build a solid foundation for managing and processing large-scale data efficiently.

## üí° My Expertise

I demystify data tools to make them accessible and efficient:
